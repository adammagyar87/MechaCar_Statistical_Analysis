# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- Pricing compared to vehicles in our segment is always first and foremost when considering a purchase. Fuel efficiency is a key factor, and then depending on target audience the safety rating would rank high as well.

### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- The null hypothesis is that MechaCar is not statistically different than the other cars in our segment. The alternative hypothesis would be that our metrics set us apart from the competition.


### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- The t test because it can be used to directly compare two distinct populations of data.

### What data is needed to run the statistical test?
- We would need to gather the pricing, fuel efficiency, and safety ratings of competitors vehicles in our segment.
